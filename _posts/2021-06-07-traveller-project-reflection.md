Overall, what did you achieve in your project? 
What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of? 
What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project? (You are not responsible for doing those things.) 
How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (if you didn't complete everything in your proposal, that's fine!)
What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc? 
How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible.

For a math student who aspired to be a data scientist one day, opportunities to collaborate with others to complete a coding project are extremely valuable for me. When I was taking PIC 16B at UCLA, I was very lucky to meet [Ashley Lu]() and [Jingxuan Zhang]() because of our common interests in travelling, especially during this unusual circumstance of Covid 19, and we were able to learn, think, and design this project together, [LA Travel Planner](https://github.com/jren99/pic16b_project), which was not only a programming project that we are all really proud of but also a reflection of what we want to realize in real world using what we've learned in the classroom. I want to take this opportunity to share my experience with you in hopes of motivating you if you are struggling with your own project.
