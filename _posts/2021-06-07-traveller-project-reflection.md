What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of? 

What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project? (You are not responsible for doing those things.) 

How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (if you didn't complete everything in your proposal, that's fine!)

What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc? 

How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible.

For a math student who aspired to be a data scientist one day, opportunities to collaborate with others to complete a coding project are extremely valuable for me. When I was taking PIC 16B at UCLA, I was very lucky to meet [Ashley Lu]() and [Jingxuan Zhang]() because of our common interests in travelling, especially during this unusual circumstance of Covid 19, and we were able to learn, think, and design this project together, [LA Travel Planner](https://github.com/jren99/pic16b_project), which was not only a programming project that we are all really proud of but also a reflection of what we want to realize in real world using what we've learned in the classroom. I want to take this opportunity to share my experience with you in hopes of motivating you if you are struggling with your own project. 

### Project Overview

When it comes to traveling, sometimes it can be a struggle to plan out where you want to go, especially if you're going somewhere you've never been to before. Our project creates a travel planning tool that gives attraction, hotel, and food recommendations to LA tourists, and provides a detailed and personalized travel plan based on users' selections, including attractions to go for each day and a route recommendation. 

For example, under "Restaurant Recommendations", users can either enter the type of food they are interested to filter corresponding restaurants, or enter a number (for example, 3.5) to filter restaurants with ratings higher than the input number.

For the "Plan Your Trip!" section, users can generate a customized travel plan based on their inputs, including a plan summary and maps for each day.

### Highlights 

This project has been a wild journey. We came up with a proposal that none of us knew how to make it come true but eventually completed something that none of us ever thought we were able to do.
